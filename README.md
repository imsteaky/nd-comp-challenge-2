using CSS grid and a bit of hopes and dreams, I whipped together a rather nice card 
layout for Maxfund. my hopes are to work on this a bit more after evals and give it to Maxfund to use.

MaxFund is a non-profit organization, no-kill shelter, established May 1988.

They take in and nurture any injured animal with no known owner.

They find loving forever homes for these animals once they have recovered.

The cute doggo in my github profile picture came from maxfund almost 8 years ago!
